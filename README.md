# Intro
Put data analysis skills into action throught some projects daily 
# Python Projects
# 1) [Exploring the NYC Airbnb Market](https://github.com/3mralaa159/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/Exploring%20the%20NYC%20Airbnb%20Market)
This project delves into the dynamic Airbnb market in New York City, examining trends, pricing dynamics, and factors that impact listing popularity.
Through data science techniques and visualizations, our goal is to uncover insights into host and guest behaviors in one of the world's most dynamic hospitality markets.
  
# 2)[Word Frequency Classic Novels](https://github.com/3mralaa159/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/Word%20Frequency%20Classic%20Novels)
In this project, I analyzed the word frequencies of classic novels using Python programming language.
The goal was to gain insights into the most frequently used words in these literary works, offering a deeper understanding of their themes and styles.
## Questions:
- What are the most frequent words in Herman Melville's novel Moby Dick and how often do they occur?
## 🔑 Key Features:
- Implemented text processing techniques to tokenize and clean the text data.
- Utilized Python libraries requests \ BeautifulSoup to extract \ edit online files (web scrapping)
- Utilized Python libraries such as NLTK and Seaborn for natural language processing and visualization.
- Generated visualizations like bar plots to display the top words and their frequencies.
- Applied basic statistical analysis to extract meaningful insights from the data.

# 3)[Exploring the Bitcoin Cryptocurrency Market](https://github.com/3mralaa159/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/Exploring%20the%20Bitcoin%20Cryptocurrency%20Market)
the project dedicated to exploring the dynamic world of Bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency that has revolutionized finance and technology.
This project aims to provide insights, tools, and resources for anyone interested in understanding Bitcoin's market trends, price movements, and underlying technologies.
## Question
- how volatile the cryptocurrency of top 10 market capitalizations.?
## 🔑 Key Features:
- Develop Python scripts and customized functions for data scraping, analysis, and visualization of Bitcoin-related metrics(Pandas,matplot)
- Apply some cleaning for dataset
- Analyze Bitcoin's price movements over time, including daily, weekly trends by combining user defined function and matplot
- Track and analyze trading volumes and market capitalization changes to understand market liquidity and investor sentiment.

# 4) [Analyze Your Runkeeper Fitness Data](https://github.com/3mralaa159/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/Analyze%20Your%20Runkeeper%20Fitness%20Data)
In an age where personal fitness is increasingly data-driven, understanding and analyzing our exercise habits can provide valuable insights into our health and progress. The "Analyze Your Runkeeper Fitness Data" project aims to delve deep into the wealth of information captured by the popular Runkeeper app. By exploring this data, participants can uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that illuminate their running and fitness journey. From tracking distances and speeds to visualizing progress over time, this project offers a hands-on opportunity to harness data analytics for personal health improvement. Whether you're an avid runner seeking to optimize performance or simply curious about your fitness patterns, this project invites you to explore the intersection of technology and personal wellness through data analysis.
## Questions
- What is your average distance?
- How fast do you run?
- Do you measure your heart rate?
- How often do you train?
- Training Heart zones.?
- Goals status
## 🔑 Key Features:
- putting matplotlib into action with more depth to explore data and answer different questions
- applying cleaning skills to perfectly analyze dataset
- TimeSeries analysis
- Summarize outcome of analysis by concatenating all table together

# 5) [Visualizing COVID-19].()
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted global health, economies, and daily life. To understand and mitigate its effects, data visualization plays a crucial role in presenting complex data in an accessible and comprehensible manner. This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data through various visualization techniques, enabling better insights and decision-making.
## 🔑 Key Features:
- Using OOP and lambda to help Transform data to better understanding
- Moving from matplotlib to plotly_express for more visualization options
- Using new library pycountry to help extract information from data
- Applying some cleaning / transformation along the project
