# 2)[Word Frequency Classic Novels](https://github.com/3mralaa159/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/Word%20Frequency%20Classic%20Novels)
In this project, I analyzed the word frequencies of classic novels using Python programming language.
The goal was to gain insights into the most frequently used words in these literary works, offering a deeper understanding of their themes and styles.
## ðŸ”‘ Key Features:
- Implemented text processing techniques to tokenize and clean the text data.
- Utilized Python libraries requests \ BeautifulSoup to extract \ edit online files (web scrapping)
- Utilized Python libraries such as NLTK and Seaborn for natural language processing and visualization.
- Generated visualizations like bar plots to display the top words and their frequencies.
- Applied basic statistical analysis to extract meaningful insights from the data.

# 3)[Exploring the Bitcoin Cryptocurrency Market](https://github.com/3mralaa159/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/Exploring%20the%20Bitcoin%20Cryptocurrency%20Market)
the project dedicated to exploring the dynamic world of Bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency that has revolutionized finance and technology.
This project aims to provide insights, tools, and resources for anyone interested in understanding Bitcoin's market trends, price movements, and underlying technologies.
## ðŸ”‘ Key Features:
- Develop Python scripts and customized functions for data scraping, analysis, and visualization of Bitcoin-related metrics(Pandas,matplot)
- Apply some cleaning for dataset
- Analyze Bitcoin's price movements over time, including daily, weekly trends by combining user defined function and matplot
- Track and analyze trading volumes and market capitalization changes to understand market liquidity and investor sentiment.

# 4) [Analyze Your Runkeeper Fitness Data](https://github.com/3mralaa159/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/Analyze%20Your%20Runkeeper%20Fitness%20Data)
In an age where personal fitness is increasingly data-driven, understanding and analyzing our exercise habits can provide valuable insights into our health and progress. The "Analyze Your Runkeeper Fitness Data" project aims to delve deep into the wealth of information captured by the popular Runkeeper app. By exploring this data, participants can uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that illuminate their running and fitness journey. From tracking distances and speeds to visualizing progress over time, this project offers a hands-on opportunity to harness data analytics for personal health improvement. Whether you're an avid runner seeking to optimize performance or simply curious about your fitness patterns, this project invites you to explore the intersection of technology and personal wellness through data analysis.
## ðŸ”‘ Key Features:
- putting matplotlib into action with more depth to explore data and answer different questions
- applying cleaning skills to perfectly analyze dataset
- TimeSeries analysis
- Summarize outcome of analysis by concatenating all table together

# 5) [Visualizing COVID-19](https://github.com/3mralaa159/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/Visualizing%20COVID-19)
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted global health, economies, and daily life. To understand and mitigate its effects, data visualization plays a crucial role in presenting complex data in an accessible and comprehensible manner. This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data through various visualization techniques, enabling better insights and decision-making.
## ðŸ”‘ Key Features:
- Using OOP and lambda to help Transform data to better understanding
- Moving from matplotlib to plotly_express for more visualization options
- Using new library pycountry to help extract information from data
- Applying some cleaning / transformation along the project 

# 6)[Insights from Failed Orders](https://github.com/3mralaa159/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/Insights%20from%20Failed%20Orders)
In this project, we delve into the analysis of order failures within a logistics system. By examining two key datasetsâ€”data_orders, which details the specifics of each order, and data_offers, which links orders to offersâ€”we aim to uncover insights into the reasons behind order cancellations and rejections. Our focus is to build a comprehensive understanding of failure distribution, analyze temporal patterns, and assess cancellation times based on driver assignment. The ultimate goal is to identify trends and anomalies that can inform strategies to reduce failure rates and enhance overall operational efficiency.
## ðŸ”‘ Key Features:
- Failure Distribution Insight: Identifying and categorizing order failures provides a clear view of the most common reasons for cancellations and rejections, which can help prioritize areas for improvement.
- Temporal Patterns: Analyzing the distribution of failed orders by hour reveals peak times with higher failure rates, helping to target specific times for process optimization or resource allocation.
- Impact of Driver Assignment: Comparing cancellation times with and without driver assignments highlights the effects of driver involvement on order outcomes, providing valuable insights into driver-related issues.
- Data Anomalies: Recognizing outliers in cancellation times helps in understanding exceptional cases that could skew average values and may necessitate further investigation or corrective measures.
- Strategic Improvements: The findings from these analyses can guide strategic adjustments, such as operational changes or targeted interventions, to enhance overall efficiency and reduce failure rates in the logistics system.
